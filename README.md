## Introduction

BESS is an initiative that provides structured open data for the built environment, enabling data sharing and connectivity.  
The platform is built on the principles of Linked Data, ensuring that the data can be easily connected with other data sources on the web.  
This enables the creation of a network of built environment data that can be used in a wide range of applications.

## The BESS Ontology


## Persistent Identifier

We use the w3id.org service to provide a persistent identifier for the BESS platform.  
This identifier will be used to reference all vocabularies, instance identifiers, and linked data resources related to the BESS platform:

```
https://w3id.org/bess
```

Using a persistent identifier ensures long-term stability and makes it easier to reference BESS resources across the web.

All BESS ontologies will be released under the `CC-BY` licence, ensuring they can be freely reused.
